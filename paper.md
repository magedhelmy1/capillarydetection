# Summary
Analyzing the microvascular supply by quantifying the capillary area can predict life-threatening diseases like Sepsis.
Estimating the capillary area knowledge can assist medical personals in the decision-making process towards the patient's treatment.
Readily available handheld microscopes have allowed the ease of capturing capillary images from the microcirculation system.
However, quantifying these capillaries in the captured images remains a tedious labor-intense job subject to inter-observer variability.
This paper presents an end-to-end system that can detect the capillaries and quantify the capillary area captured by these handheld microscopic devices.
We evaluated our system with an industrial MedTech partner specialized in tailored patient therapy by assessing the microcirculation system.
This system has a high clinical relevance because it significantly reduces the time to quantify capillaries from 2 minutes to less than 2 seconds by automating the laborious task of annotating the capillaries in the image.
Furthermore, it eliminates inter-observer variability by standardizing the analysis process using deep learning algorithms.
